Since March 8, 1990, Womanâ€™s Day is being observed by SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) consisting of seven countries, namely, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. The day was marked to focus on the problems of girl children in these countries. It is a pity that girl children especially in underdeveloped countries are victims of extreme negligence and dishonour. The birth of a girl child is looked upon by the parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, economic facilities, and social status or honour.
